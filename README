ddserver is a server-side application for dynamic DNS management.

It allows you to specify hostnames (subdomains) inside a dynamic DNS zone, and
to update the IP address of those hostnames using a dynamic update protocol
(no-ip protocol). This enables you to access hosts with dynamic IP addresses by
a static domain name, even if the IP address changes. As updates of the IP
address are performed using the no-ip update protocol, most DSL home-routers
are able to send updates of the IP address. Also, there is a tool called
ddclient, which can be used to send updates from any *NIX-based OS.
